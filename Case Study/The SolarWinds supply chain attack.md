# The SolarWinds supply chain attack

The SolarWinds supply chain attack was a cyber espionage campaign that targeted several government agencies and private companies in the United States and other countries. The attack was carried out by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group believed to be associated with the Russian government.

The attack began in 2019, but it was not discovered until December 2020, when the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert about the compromise of SolarWinds' software update system. SolarWinds is a US-based company that provides IT management software, including network monitoring and management tools.

The attackers were able to compromise the software update system and insert a malicious code into a software update that was distributed to SolarWinds' customers. When the customers installed the update, the malicious code was also installed on their systems, giving the attackers access to their networks.

The attackers used this access to gain further access to the systems of SolarWinds' customers and then used this access to infiltrate the networks of government agencies and private companies. The attack was sophisticated and well-planned, and the attackers were able to operate undetected for a long period of time.

The attack was eventually discovered when some of the affected organizations noticed unusual activity on their networks and reported it to the authorities. The investigation into the attack is ongoing, and the full extent of the damage caused by the attack is not yet known. However, it is clear that the attack was a major breach of cybersecurity and a significant threat to national security.

“We believe the Orion platform was specifically targeted by this nation-state to create a backdoor into the IT environments of [our] select customers. The threat actor did this by adding malicious code, which we call SUNBURST, to versions released between March and June of 2020. So, a three month window was when the malicious SUNBURST code was deployed.”

– Sudhakar Ramakrishna, President & CEO, SolarWinds


“The attackers came in through the SolarWinds implant and the first thing they did is they went for your keys, your tokens. Basically they stole your identity architecture so they could access your networks the same way your people did. That’s why this attack was hard to find; these attackers, from day one, had a backdoor, a secret door, to your house, and once inside, all of your keys were laying out there. They grab them and now they can get open any locks you have in your house the same way your people do.” 

– Kevin Mandia, CEO, FireEye


“The SolarWinds Orion software update was the principal initial vector for many of these attacks, but it was not the only entry into these houses. In some instances we have seen, the Russian actor used aggressive password spray attacks to gain access. A password spray is when an attacker attempts to log in using a variety of common or relatively simple passwords against many targets, knowing that someone in an organization is likely to have one of them as their password.” 

– Brad Smith, Microsoft


“We’re doing Stage 2 investigations for our customers, and the number one other way we’re seeing these attackers break in is what’s called password spraying. […] We have 3,300 employees at FireEye. I have to believe that some of them used their fireeye.com email to access dozens if not more of the apps on the internet. If any of the vendors get compromised and they use the same passphrase for amazon.com as fireeye.com, we may have a problem.” 

– Kevin Mandia, FireEye
